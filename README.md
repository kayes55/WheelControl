# WheelControl
This project is made from Ray Wenderlich's tutorial [How To Create a Rotating Wheel Control with UIKit](https://www.raywenderlich.com/9864/how-to-create-a-rotating-wheel-control-with-uikit).
Author of this tutorial is [Cesare Rocchi](https://www.raywenderlich.com/u/funkyboy).
This tutorial was written in Objective-C and Ray's team did not update it until now. So I have decided to make
a Swift version of this useful project for learning purpose.
# Language Used
## Swift
```
Both UIView and UIControl classes are extended for reusable wheel seperately. 
Users can use one of them in their projects
